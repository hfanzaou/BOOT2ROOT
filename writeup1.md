## üñ•Ô∏è Initial Setup
When booting the Boot2Root machine, no IP address was provided. To establish connectivity:

- I configured a Host-Only Network in the VM settings.The virtual network automatically assigned an IP address to the machine.
- To discover the machine‚Äôs IP, I performed a network scan from my attacking machine using the following command:

>nmap 192.168.56.1/24


>nmap 192.168.56.1/24

Nmap Results:
```

```
From the scan, the target machine is 192.168.56.101.

## üîç Service Enumeration
The open ports identified on the target machine were:
```
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps
```
Among these, SSH, FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS were of particular interest.

- ### Web Services :
    - Accessing http://192.168.56.101 showed a simple webpage containing only the word ‚Äúhackme‚Äù with no additional content or functionality.Inspecting the page source and elements revealed no useful information or client-side code.
    - Checking the HTTPS site (https://192.168.56.101) at the root path.

- ### Subdomain Discovery:
    Further probing for possible subdomains on the HTTPS server uncovered several interesting web services:
    we use dirb tool for that:

- Forum ‚Äî a discussion board containing posts and user data.

- Webmailer ‚Äî a webmail client interface.

The forum was functional and allowed user logins, providing a potential entry point for further exploration.
## üîç Forum and Credential Harvesting
### üìë Forum Access
- Inside the forum, I found a post titled ‚ÄúLogin problems‚Äù which contained logs of failed login attempts by a user named lmezard.

- Exploring lmezard‚Äôs profile, I found an associated email address.
- Exploring lmezard‚Äôs profile, I found an associated email address.

### üìß Webmailer Access

- Using the same email address and the password from the forum, I logged into the webmailer service. The credentials were accepted, granting me access to lmezard‚Äôs mailbox.
### üìß Webmailer Access

- Using the same email address and the password from the forum, I logged into the webmailer service. The credentials were accepted, granting me access to lmezard‚Äôs mailbox.

- Inside the mailbox, I discovered an email containing database credentials with the username root.
- Inside the mailbox, I discovered an email containing database credentials with the username root.

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Access

- After gaining database access, I created a SQL file on the server containing queries to execute system commands. This allowed me to run commands directly on the server.
- While navigating the file system, I discovered a directory named LOOKATME. Inside this directory, there was a file named password.
- I tested the contents of this password file in various authentication systems and services on the machine but initially found no success.
- Eventually, I tried using this password as the authentication code for the FTP service. This attempt was successful, granting me access to the FTP server.

### üìÅ FTP Access
- Inside the FTP server, I found several .pcap files. When I tried to open them with Wireshark, they did not appear to be valid .pcap files.
- I manually inspected the files and noticed they contained scattered chunks of C code, but the code was out of order.
- I gathered all the contents from these files into a single file, reconstructed the correct order of the code, and then compiled and executed it.
- After running the executable, the program output:
```
"MY PASSWORD IS : Iheartpawnage"
```

- Alongside the .pcap files, there was also a Readme file that instructed me to hash the password and use the resulting hash as the SSH password for the user laurie.

    ```
    This is the SSH password for the user laurie.
## üë©‚Äçüíª User laurie Access
Upon successfully logging in as laurie, I conducted an initial enumeration of the user's home directory:
>ls -la
```
-rwxr-x--- 1 laurie   laurie 26943 Oct  8  2015 bomb
-rwxr-x--- 1 laurie   laurie   158 Oct  8  2015 README
```
- ### üìÑ README
    The README file contained the following message:
    ```
    Diffuse this bomb!
    When you have all the passwords, use them as "thor" user with SSH.

    HINT:
    P
    2
    b

    o
    4

    NO SPACE IN THE PASSWORD (password is case sensitive).
    ```
- ### üß® bomb
    The bomb file is an executable binary. When executed, it displayed the following message:
    ```
    Welcome! This is my little bomb!!!!
    You have 6 stages with only one life.
    Good luck!! Have a nice day!
    ```
- ### üõ†Ô∏è Reverse Engineering the Bomb

    To understand the bomb's logic, I used Ghidra to disassemble the binary into a more understandable format. Through analysis, I determined that the executable requires six passwords to prevent the bomb from detonating.

    Using GDB and Ghidra, I meticulously examined each stage of the bomb, uncovering the following passcodes:
    ```
    - Public speaking is very easy.
    - 1 2 6 24 120 720 
    - 0 q 777
    - fibonacci 9
    - opekmq
    - 4 2 6 1 3 5
    ```
b *0x08048e70
b *0x08048e60
0x08048dca
set $node = *(int *)0x804b26c
set $count = 0
while $node != 0 && $count < 6
  printf "Node @ %p, value = %d\n", $node, *(int *)$node
  set $node = *(int *)($node + 8)
  set $count = $count + 1
end
    #### for phase_5 we used gdb to find the comaparizon array
    steps:
    ```
    gdb ./bomb
    b main
    disass main
    b phase_5
    disass phase_5
    # This loads the base address of the lookup table (array_123) into register %esi.
    mov $0x804b220, %esi
    # to print the array content
    x/16cb 0x804b220
    ```
    this gives us the array:
    "isrveawhobpnutfg"

    #### for phase_6 we used gdb to find the cotent of the linked list

    Combining these passcodes to form the SSH password for the user thor.

```
- ### üìÑ README
    The README file contained the following message:
    ```
    Finish this challenge and use the result as password for 'zaz' user.
    ```
- ### üê¢ turtle
    The turtle file contains movement instructions such as:

        Tourne gauche de X degrees (Turn left by X degrees)
        Tourne droite de X degrees (Turn right by X degrees)
        Avance X spaces (Move forward X spaces)
        Recule X spaces (Move backward X spaces)
        The file ends with:
        "Can you digest the message? :)"
- ### üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach
    The challenge suggests parsing the instructions and drawing them using the Python turtle module to reveal a hidden message that will serve as the password for the zaz user.
    ![Turtle Result](Screenshot.png)
    so the word here is "SLASH", we have to hash it with md5 before using it as password for zaz.
    ```
        Python 3
        >>> import hashlib
        >>> hashlib.md5(b"SLASH").hexdigest()
