# Boot2Root 

## Overview

This repository contains detailed writeups for the Boot2Root machine. The objective is to gain root access by exploiting system vulnerabilities and privilege escalation techniques.

The project includes:
- 🛠️ **Mandatory Writeups (2):**  
  - The first method follows an intended path through the machine, moving from user to user by carefully enumerating and exploiting accessible resources. The final privilege escalation is achieved by exploiting a buffer overflow in a file named exploit_me found in the last user
  - Exploits the Dirty COW (CVE-0000-0000) kernel vulnerability to gain root access directly by leveraging a local privilege escalation exploit.

- 🎯 **Bonus Writeups (3):**  
  - Cron job privilege escalation
  -
